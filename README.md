# Umeed For Women

## About

An application developed using node.js/express web application for higher levels of hierarchy and android application for lower levels of hierarchy.

Keeping in mind the constraints provided to us by organization, we have developed an android application using very less bandwidth and extensive compression. As for the web application, we provided an admin panel, tracking the progress, approving tasks, tracking sessions, as well as automatically calculating compensation.

We also have many future plans for the future, ranging from automatic task assignment, integration with bank as well as automatic efficiency calculation
